For a developer-focused blog that’s engaging for readers and optimized for SEO, aim for a **word count between 1,200 and 2,000 words**. Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **1,200–1,500 words**: Great for covering a specific topic in depth, such as tutorials, code walkthroughs, or tech explanations. This length balances detail with reader engagement.
- **1,500–2,000 words**: Suitable for more in-depth articles like comparative analyses, case studies, or advanced concepts. Articles in this range can perform well in search engines, especially if they’re comprehensive.

### Structure Tips for Engagement and SEO
1. **Start with an Intro (50–100 words)**: Outline the topic and hook the reader.
2. **Subheadings Every 200–300 Words**: Improves readability and helps SEO by organizing the article into clear sections.
3. **Use Code Examples or Visuals**: Break up text with examples, images, or diagrams.
4. **Short Paragraphs**: Aim for 2–3 sentences per paragraph for easy skimming.
5. **Add a Conclusion or Summary (50–100 words)**: Recap key points for readers and offer further resources.

### SEO Best Practices
- **Use Targeted Keywords**: Place keywords naturally in titles, subheadings, and body text.
- **Include Internal Links**: Link to relevant articles on your site to keep readers engaged.
- **Optimize Meta Description**: Summarize the content in 150–160 characters to improve click-through rates.

This structure keeps your content reader-friendly while hitting SEO marks effectively.
